Infiltrator is a console hacking simulation game that was initially
for Windows but is being designed to be easily ported in the future.
For the license terms, see 'license.txt'.

+ Objective
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

You are a hacker for hire. Your current client, Evan Smith, has set up
a bank account under an alias. He has hired you to hack into the banks
mainframe and funnel money from an account into the dummy account.
The bank is a private bank that is tightly secured, all network
connections are heavily encrypted, and the accounts strictly guarded.
You both stand to make millions.

+ Build
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

Infiltrator is built with Visual C++ 2010. In the future there may
be solutions for earlier versions of VC++ included in the repo.

Infiltrator depends on the Boost C++ Library <http://www.boost.org/>
The Boost version Infiltrator is currently being tested with is 1.51.
As of now, you must get a copy of Boost yourself, but in the future
Infiltrator may include the necessary Boost libraries.
