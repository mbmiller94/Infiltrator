# Infiltrator

**Author:** *Micheal Brandon Miller* | **Email:** *<lectisoft@gmail.com>*

Infiltrator is a console hacking simulation game that was initially
for Windows but is being designed to be easily ported in the future.
For the license terms, see 'license.txt'.

### Objective

You are a hacker for hire. Your current client, Evan Smith, has set up
a bank account under an alias. He has hired you to hack into the banks
mainframe and funnel money from an account into the dummy account.

The bank is privately owned meaning more security, heavily encrypted network
connections, and strictly guarded accounts. You both stand to make millions.

### Build

Infiltrator is built with Visual C++ 2010. In the future there may
be solutions for earlier versions of VC++ included in the repo.

Infiltrator depends on the Boost C++ Library <http://www.boost.org/>
The Boost version Infiltrator is currently being tested with is 1.51.
As of now, you must get a copy of Boost yourself, but in the future
Infiltrator may include the necessary Boost libraries.
